# Hello and welcome to my site

I'm a poet and short story writer based in the south west of the UK, who writes surreal and imagistic work. I also perform as a spoken word artist. My writing has been nominated for the Forward Prize and has appeared in <em>Neon Magazine</em>, <em>Nine Muses Poetry</em> and <em>Marble Poetry</em>.

This website has all my writings and my books. It also has a blog I've been maintaining for 7 years. Subjects include art, politics, poems and anything else I fancy.

[Here](https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/now) is what I'm up to now.
