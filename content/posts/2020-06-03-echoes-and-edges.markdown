title: Echoes and Edges Collaboration
---
<a href="http://facebook.com/echoesandedges">Echoes and edges</a> were kind enough to set my poem *How to hear the hills* to an incredible deep soundtrack as part of their live stream collaboration. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/RL3WjakLW8Y">watch it here.</a>

They also sent me an mp3 of the song and I've uploaded it to SoundCloud. Find <a href="https://soundcloud.com/davidralphlewis/david-ralph-lewis-echoes-and">that here</a>. What they've done with my poem is really powerful but the whole live stream is really cool.
