When the earth was correcting  
our cabled bodies were sprawled  
irreparable, most sensory inputs  
disconnected, transmissions down,  
smashed by careless hands wielding  
boulders. When networks were down,  
when communities were rewiring  
like dust scattered in sunbeams,  
We stayed immobile in deserts,  
newly separate and confused  
listening to automated number   
stations, comfort in the night.

Looking through my drafts recently, I realised this one was never posted. Pascal Vine was asking for prompts a while back, so I gave them the prompt "All we listened to was a number station". I wrote a response to it as well. This predates covid but feels very relevant now.
