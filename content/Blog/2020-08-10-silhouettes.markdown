Drunk dancers stumbling over earth,  
we expect to leave no trace behind.  

After centuries of exponential progress  
the sudden fury of suns is released.  

Afterwards, on bricks still standing  
we are etched silhouettes embracing.  

Our outlines entwined, two dimensions,  
diminished by the judgement of light.

[75 years later](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-53648572), we still hear the echoes.
