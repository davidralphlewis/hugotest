title: New poem at Highland Park Poetry
---
  

Hello, I'm really pleased to have a new poem at Highland Park Poetry called *Fluvial Dreams.* All the poems are water themed. Check it out <a href="http://highlandparkpoetry.org/themusesgallery.html">here</a>.   



I also really like *Storm After Drought* by Donna Pucciani. Have a look at all the poems.
